# External software required by this config

Everything **outside Emacs** that this configuration expects to find on the
system. Missing Emacs packages install automatically on startup through
`use-package` (`src/dk-packages.el`); `M-x dk/install-packages` remains
available when you want to install the complete set explicitly.

The editing helpers `multiple-cursors`, `wgrep`, `avy`, and `vundo` are pure
Emacs Lisp packages and add no external software requirements.

Every entry names the configuration file that needs it, so anything belonging
to a language you don't use can be dropped.  Exact line numbers are omitted so
the references do not become stale after unrelated edits.

Package names are for **Arch Linux**; other distros are noted where the name
differs. Verified against Emacs 30.2.

`.gitignore` excludes `elpa/`, `tree-sitter/`, `eln-cache/` and `custom.el` —
a fresh clone rebuilds all four, see [§9](#9-post-install-inside-emacs).

---

## 0. TL;DR — clean Arch install

```bash
# Emacs + core tooling
sudo pacman -S --needed emacs git base-devel gnupg ripgrep fd pandoc-cli

# LSP servers, compilers, formatters
sudo pacman -S --needed clang go gopls rustup

# Rust toolchain
rustup default stable
rustup component add rustfmt clippy rust-analyzer

# Haskell — ghcup, not pacman (keeps GHC/HLS/fourmolu in sync)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
ghcup install ghc      --set latest
ghcup install cabal    --set latest
ghcup install hls      --set latest
cabal install fourmolu
# add ~/.ghcup/bin and ~/.cabal/bin to PATH

# Optional formatters for the non-code file types (see §6)
sudo pacman -S --needed taplo-cli prettier shfmt dprint

# Fonts
sudo pacman -S --needed ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols
yay -S ttf-iosevka             # AUR only (or paru -S ttf-iosevka)

# Org directory referenced by org-agenda-files
mkdir -p ~/org
```

Then launch Emacs and run the steps in [§9](#9-post-install-inside-emacs)
(tree-sitter grammars — those are compiled locally, not packaged).

---

## 1. Emacs itself

**Emacs 30.1 or newer is required.** The config uses `setopt` (29+), built-in
`use-package` (29+), `treesit` (29+), built-in `which-key`
(`src/dk-ui.el`, 30+), `major-mode-remap-alist` (`src/dk-treesit.el`,
29+) and `eglot-events-buffer-config` (`src/dk-programming.el`, 30+).
`completion-pcm-leading-wildcard` is guarded in `src/dk-completion.el`: it is
used automatically on Emacs 31+, but does not raise the minimum version.

| Build feature | Configure flag | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| tree-sitter | `--with-tree-sitter` | the whole of `src/dk-treesit.el`; every `*-ts-mode` |
| dynamic modules | `--with-modules` | loading the compiled grammar `.so` files |
| native compilation | `--with-native-compilation` | `eln-cache/`, startup speed (`early-init.el`) |
| GUI build (X11/pgtk) | default | fonts (`src/dk-ui.el`), fringe bitmaps (`src/dk-programming.el`), corfu's child-frame popup |
| HarfBuzz | `--with-harfbuzz` | the shaping that turns the composition rules in `src/dk-ui.el` into ligature glyphs |

Arch's `extra/emacs` ships all five. A terminal-only build still mostly works
— `diff-hl` falls back to the margin — but corfu's popup needs a child frame,
and the font settings and fringe indicators are inert there. Ligatures are
inert there too, for a different reason: in `emacs -nw` the glyphs are the
terminal emulator's to draw, whatever this config asks for.

To confirm the build has what the ligatures need:

```elisp
(and (display-graphic-p) (string-match-p "HARFBUZZ" system-configuration-features))
```

`emacsclient` ships with Emacs and is required by `with-editor`, which magit
uses for commit messages.

Non-Arch: Debian/Ubuntu ship Emacs 29 or older on LTS releases — check
`emacs --version` before assuming the distro package is enough.

---

## 2. Core tooling

Needed no matter which languages you use.

| Binary | Arch package | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| `git` | `git` | magit (`src/dk-vcs.el`), diff-hl (`src/dk-vcs.el`), `project-try-vc` root detection (`src/dk-navigation.el`), `vc-follow-symlinks` (`src/dk-defaults.el`), and cloning every tree-sitter grammar repo (`src/dk-treesit.el`) |
| `gcc`, `g++`, `make` | `base-devel` | compiling tree-sitter grammars (§8) — the C++ compiler is needed for grammars whose external scanner is C++. Also libgccjit for native-comp. |
| `rg` | `ripgrep` | `consult-ripgrep`, bound to `C-x p g` / `C-c p g` and offered in `project-switch-commands` (`src/dk-navigation.el`) |
| `find`, `grep` | `findutils`, `grep` | `consult-find` on `C-c f` (`src/dk-completion.el`); `consult-grep` via `M-x`. Both in Arch `core`. |
| `pandoc` | `pandoc-cli` | `markdown-command` (`src/dk-writing.el`) — `markdown-preview` / `markdown-export`. Arch's package is `pandoc-cli`, **not** `pandoc` (that is the Haskell library). |
| `gpg` | `gnupg` | verifying signed ELPA packages on first install. Optional but recommended. |
| GNU `ls` | `coreutils` | `dired-listing-switches` uses `--group-directories-first` (`src/dk-navigation.el`), a GNU extension. Present on any Linux; only an issue on BSD/macOS. |

**Optional:** `fd` — nothing in the config binds `consult-fd`, but it is much
faster than `find` if you reach for it via `M-x`.

---

## 3. LSP servers

`eglot-ensure` runs in these modes (`src/dk-programming.el`,
`src/dk-languages.el`). A missing server means no completion or
diagnostics for that language; nothing else breaks.

| Binary | Arch package | Trigger | Configured with |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clangd` | `clang` | `c-ts-mode`, `c++-ts-mode` | `--clang-tidy` (`src/dk-languages.el`); language-standard overrides belong in a project compilation database or conditional `.clangd` file |
| `rust-analyzer` | `rust-analyzer`, or `rustup component add rust-analyzer` | `rustic-mode` | `:check (:command "clippy")` — needs `cargo-clippy`, see §7 (`src/dk-languages.el`) |
| `gopls` | `gopls` | `go-ts-mode` | stock (`src/dk-programming.el`) |
| `haskell-language-server-wrapper` | **ghcup**, see §7 | `haskell-mode` and `haskell-ts-mode` | `--lsp` (`src/dk-languages.el`) |

The Haskell entry must be the `-wrapper` binary — it dispatches to the HLS
build matching each project's GHC. Do not install a bare
`haskell-language-server`.

Non-Arch: clangd is `clangd` on Debian/Ubuntu and `clang-tools-extra` on
Fedora. If `gopls` isn't packaged, `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest`.

---

## 4. Formatters — required

`apheleia-global-mode` is on (`src/dk-programming.el`) and is the **only**
formatter in the config: the per-language `before-save-hook` formatters and
Rustic's own format-on-save path are disabled. apheleia picks the tool from its own
`apheleia-mode-alist`, so these are the ones the languages here resolve to.

| Binary | Arch package | Formats | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rustfmt` | `rustup component add rustfmt` | `rustic-mode`, `rust-mode`, `rust-ts-mode` | |
| `gofmt` | `go` | `go-ts-mode` | ships inside the `go` package |
| `clang-format` | `clang` | `c-ts-mode`, `c++-ts-mode` | only runs in trees that contain `.clang-format` or `_clang-format` — `dk/no-clang-format-p` (`src/dk-functions.el`) inhibits it everywhere else |
| `fourmolu` | `cabal install fourmolu` (or `ghcup`, or AUR `fourmolu-bin`) | `haskell-mode`, `haskell-ts-mode` | apheleia's Haskell default is fourmolu, **not** ormolu |

The `clang-format` package also provides the `clang-format` Emacs commands
(`src/dk-languages.el`), which call the same binary.

---

## 5. Language toolchains

Install only what you use.

### Rust
| Binary | Source | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| `cargo` | `rustup` | rustic drives every build/test/run through cargo (`src/dk-languages.el`) |
| `rustfmt` | `rustup component add rustfmt` | apheleia, §4 |
| `cargo-clippy` | `rustup component add clippy` | the `:check (:command "clippy")` option handed to rust-analyzer |

`rustup` and the distro `rust` package conflict — pick one. `rustup` keeps
rustfmt/clippy/rust-analyzer versions matched to the toolchain.

### Go
| Binary | Arch package | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| `go`, `gofmt` | `go` | building; `gofmt` is apheleia's Go formatter |
| `gopls` | `gopls` | eglot, §3 |

### C / C++
| Binary | Arch package | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| `clangd`, `clang-format` | `clang` | §3, §4 |
| `gcc`, `g++` | `base-devel` | compiling; also grammar builds |

### Haskell
| Binary | Source | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| `ghc` | ghcup | compiler; HLS must match its version |
| `cabal` | ghcup | `haskell-process-type` is `'cabal-repl` (`src/dk-languages.el`) — `C-c C-z` and `C-c C-l` both go through `cabal repl` |
| `haskell-language-server-wrapper` | `ghcup install hls` | eglot, §3 |
| `fourmolu` | `cabal install fourmolu` | apheleia, §4 |

Use **ghcup**, not pacman: HLS is built against an exact GHC version and Arch's
`ghc` regularly drifts ahead of what HLS supports. Put `~/.ghcup/bin` and
`~/.cabal/bin` on `PATH`.

Note `haskell-ts-mode` (`src/dk-languages.el`) drives a bare `ghci` via
`dk/haskell-ts-run-repl`, while `haskell-mode` uses `cabal repl` — both come from ghcup.

---

## 6. Formatters — optional

`src/dk-treesit.el` maps a set of extra file types onto built-in ts modes,
and apheleia has a default formatter for most of them. Without the binary,
saving such a file logs an apheleia error and leaves the buffer untouched —
harmless, but noisy. Install the ones you care about, or drop the entry from
`apheleia-mode-alist`.

| File type | Mode | Formatter | Arch package |
|---|---|---|---|
| TOML (`Cargo.toml`, …) | `toml-ts-mode` | `taplo` | `taplo-cli` |
| YAML | `yaml-ts-mode` | `prettier` | `prettier` (needs `nodejs`) |
| JSON | `json-ts-mode` | `prettier` | `prettier` |
| shell scripts | `bash-ts-mode` | `shfmt` | `shfmt` |
| `CMakeLists.txt`, `*.cmake` | `cmake-ts-mode` | `cmake-format` | AUR `cmake-format`, or `pipx install cmakelang` |
| `Dockerfile`, `Containerfile` | `dockerfile-ts-mode` | `dprint` | Arch `extra/dprint` (`sudo pacman -S dprint`), or `cargo install dprint` |

Emacs Lisp is formatted by apheleia's built-in `lisp-indent` — no external
binary.

Markdown is deliberately absent from `apheleia-mode-alist` upstream, so `.md`
files are never reformatted on save.

---

## 7. Fonts

| Font | Arch package | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| **Iosevka** | `ttf-iosevka` — **AUR only** (`yay`/`paru`) | used by the `default` face and by a buffer-local `default` remap in minibuffers (`src/dk-vars.el`, applied in `src/dk-ui.el`), and it is the family whose `calt`/`liga` features the ligature setup below composes. Missing → silent fallback to some other monospace font, no warning, and no ligatures. |
| **Symbols Nerd Font Mono** | `ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols` | `nerd-icons`, the single icon backend here: doom-modeline (`src/dk-ui.el`), `nerd-icons-dired` (`src/dk-navigation.el`), `nerd-icons-corfu` (`src/dk-completion.el`). Missing → tofu boxes everywhere. |

Not on Arch: upstream Iosevka releases are at `github.com/be5invis/Iosevka` —
unzip into `~/.local/share/fonts/` and run `fc-cache -f`. For the Nerd Font,
`M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts` downloads and installs it from inside Emacs.

To use a different font instead, edit `dk/font-family` in `src/dk-vars.el` —
it is referenced from one place only. One constraint on the replacement: the
`ligature` package (`src/dk-ui.el`) installs composition rules, but the
glyphs come from the font's own OpenType features, so a family built without
`calt`/`liga` silently gets no ligatures. That is exactly why **Aporetic Sans
Mono**, the previous value here, was dropped: its monospaced cuts ship
`cv01`–`cv99` and `ss01`–`ss20` but no ligature features at all. To check a
candidate before switching:

```bash
python3 - <<'EOF'
import struct
p = '/usr/share/fonts/TTF/Iosevka-Regular.ttf'   # path to the font file
d = open(p, 'rb').read()
tabs = {d[12+16*i:16+16*i].decode('latin1'): struct.unpack('>II', d[20+16*i:28+16*i])
        for i in range(struct.unpack('>H', d[4:6])[0])}
o = tabs['GSUB'][0]
flo = o + struct.unpack('>H', d[o+6:o+8])[0]
n = struct.unpack('>H', d[flo:flo+2])[0]
feats = {d[flo+2+6*i:flo+6+6*i].decode('latin1') for i in range(n)}
print(sorted(feats & {'liga', 'calt', 'clig', 'dlig'}) or 'no ligature features')
EOF
```

---

## 8. Tree-sitter grammars

`tree-sitter/` is git-ignored, so **a fresh clone has no grammars**. They are
cloned and compiled locally at pinned revisions
(`src/dk-treesit.el`) — Arch's packaged grammars are deliberately not used
(it only ships a few, and they track an ABI this Emacs cannot load).

Twelve grammars: `bash` `c` `cmake` `cpp` `dockerfile` `go` `gomod` `haskell`
`json` `rust` `toml` `yaml`.

Build requirements: `git`, `gcc`, `g++`, `make` — all from `base-devel`.
Network access to github.com.

`M-x dk/treesit-install-all` installs the grammars explicitly.  Opening a
source file never downloads or compiles a grammar implicitly, including on
Emacs 31 (`treesit-auto-install-grammar` is explicitly `never`). Until a grammar
is installed, use the classic mode where available; Go, go.mod, YAML, CMake
and Dockerfiles use plain text when their grammar is missing.

Restart Emacs after installing grammars to activate the mode selections.
Rust's parent mode is chosen when its library loads, so a restart also ensures
Rustic uses the newly installed Rust grammar.

---

## 9. Post-install inside Emacs

1. **ELPA/MELPA packages install automatically on first launch.** Expect that
   launch to take longer while package.el refreshes the archives and downloads
   the packages.  To install the complete set before an interactive launch,
   run:
   ```bash
   emacs --batch --init-directory="$HOME/.config/emacs" \
     --load src/dk-packages.el \
     --eval '(dk/install-packages t)'
   ```
   After that, `package-quickstart` (`early-init.el`) keeps startup around
   half a second.

2. **Tree-sitter grammars** — `M-x dk/treesit-install-all`
   (`C-u` prefix rebuilds ones already present).

3. **Nerd Font**, if the distro package wasn't used —
   `M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts`.

4. **Create the org directory** — `org-agenda-files` is `(list "~/org")`
   (`src/dk-vars.el`); `org-agenda` errors if it does not exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/org
   ```

5. **Optional:** install a spell checker such as `aspell`, then set
   `ispell-program-name` if needed; Markdown and Org buffers enable Flyspell
   automatically when the checker is available.

6. **Optional:** `M-x dk/recompile-config` byte-compiles `src/`
   (`src/dk-functions.el`). Not required — `load-prefer-newer` is `t`, so a
   stale `.elc` is ignored rather than loaded.

---

## 10. What you do *not* need

Listed so as not to over-install.

| Tool | Why not |
|---|---|
| `stack` | `haskell-process-type` is `'cabal-repl` (`src/dk-languages.el`) |
| `ormolu` | apheleia's Haskell formatter is **fourmolu** |
| `goimports` | apheleia uses plain `gofmt` for Go |
| `multimarkdown` | `markdown-command` is pandoc (`src/dk-writing.el`) |
| `tree-sitter` CLI | `treesit` loads compiled `.so` files directly; the Rust CLI is for grammar authors |
| `trash-cli` | `delete-by-moving-to-trash` (`src/dk-defaults.el`) uses Emacs' own freedesktop trash implementation |
| `libvterm` | no terminal emulator package in this config |
| `git-delta`, `difftastic` | magit needs nothing beyond `git` |
| `sqlite`, `graphviz`, LaTeX | no org-roam, no org-babel graphing, no LaTeX export configured |
| `aspell` / `hunspell` | optional spell checker for Markdown and Org; Flyspell activates when one is available (`src/dk-writing.el`) |
| `python` | no Python mode or grammar configured |
| `exec-path-from-shell` | only needed if Emacs is launched from a desktop launcher with a different `PATH` — see the note in §11 |

---

## 11. Verification

From a shell:

```bash
for c in emacs emacsclient git gcc g++ make find grep rg pandoc \
         clangd clang-format gopls go gofmt \
         rust-analyzer cargo rustfmt cargo-clippy \
         ghc cabal haskell-language-server-wrapper fourmolu \
         taplo prettier shfmt; do
  printf '%-36s %s\n' "$c" "$(command -v "$c" 2>/dev/null || echo MISSING)"
done

fc-list : family | grep -cw 'Iosevka'             # expect >= 1
fc-list : family | grep -ci 'symbols nerd font'   # expect >= 1
```

From inside Emacs — this is the authoritative check, since `exec-path` can
differ from the shell `PATH` when Emacs starts from a desktop launcher:

```elisp
(dolist (b '("git" "rg" "pandoc" "clangd" "clang-format" "gopls" "gofmt"
             "rust-analyzer" "cargo" "rustfmt"
             "haskell-language-server-wrapper" "cabal" "fourmolu"))
  (message "%-36s %s" b (or (executable-find b) "MISSING")))
```

And the grammars:

```elisp
(dolist (src treesit-language-source-alist)
  (message "%-12s %s" (car src)
           (if (treesit-language-available-p (car src)) "ok" "MISSING")))
```


Configuration regression tests (with packages and grammars installed):

```bash
emacs -Q --batch -L src -l test/dk-functions-test.el \
  -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
emacs --batch --init-directory="$PWD" --load early-init.el \
  --eval '(package-activate-all)' --load init.el \
  -l test/dk-integration-test.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
```
