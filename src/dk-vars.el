  "Build and cache directories to keep out of project file lists and searches.
Referenced from `project-vc-ignores' and `grep-find-ignored-directories'
\(dk-navigation.el) and from `consult-ripgrep-args' (dk-completion.el).

This is a safety net, not the primary mechanism: for a git-backed project
`project-files' shells out to `git ls-files --exclude-standard', and rg
reads .gitignore on its own, so a project that ignores its own build
directory is already handled.  The net matters for the projects that do
not -- there the whole of dist-newstyle lands in C-x p f -- and for roots
found by `project-vc-extra-root-markers' outside any repository.

Entries are bare directory names, which is the form
`grep-find-ignored-directories' and rg's --glob both want.  Globs are
allowed, hence \"cmake-build-*\".

`project-vc-ignores' needs each name with a trailing slash instead, and
dk-navigation.el appends one there.  That is not cosmetic: a bare name
becomes the pathspec `**/NAME', which matches the directory entry but
none of the files under it, so the setting silently does nothing --
there is a FIXME about it in `project--vc-list-files'.  With the slash it
takes the `NAME/ -> NAME/**' branch instead and actually prunes.")
